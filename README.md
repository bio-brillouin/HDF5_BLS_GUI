# HDF5_BLS_GUI

The HDF5_BLS_GUI is a graphical user interface (GUI) for the HDF5_BLS library. It allows users to interact with the HDF5_BLS library through a graphical interface, making it easier to:
- Create and manage HDF5 files with the HDF5_BLS convention
- Read and write data to HDF5 files
- Visualize data in HDF5 files
- Perform various operations on HDF5 files, among which:
  - Reorganizing data inside an HDF5 files
  - Exporting lines of code to access data in HDF5 files
  - Applying analysis on raw data in HDF5 files to obtain a doublet of Power Spectral Density (PSD) and Frequency array
  - Applying treatment on the doublet of PSD and Frequency array to extract Brillouin-relevant information (shift, line width, etc.)

## Installation

The package is under development but executables will be available soon.
